**To**: [VTiger Administrator]  
**From**: Elvis - RDS Team  
**Subject**: URGENT: VTiger API Permissions - Lead Generation Automation Blocked  
**Priority**: HIGH

Dear VTiger Administrator,

We need immediate assistance resolving a critical API permissions issue that's blocking our lead generation automation project (estimated value $50K+).

## Problem Summary
- **Issue**: All API attempts to create leads return `400 DUPLICATE_RECORD_FOUND`
- **API User**: elvis@rdsteam.com  
- **VTiger Instance**: https://rdsteamglobalpresenceorg.od2.vtiger.com
- **Impact**: Complete automation system development is blocked

## What We've Verified âœ…
- API connection and authentication working
- User can access all 56 modules including Leads
- Leads module shows as "createable" 
- All test data is genuinely unique (no actual duplicates)

## Root Cause
The duplicate detection rules appear overly aggressive, preventing API-based lead creation even with unique data.

## Required Actions
1. **Review duplicate detection settings** for Leads module
2. **Verify API permissions** for user elvis@rdsteam.com  
3. **Check workflow rules** that might block API operations
4. **Test lead creation** after configuration changes

## Detailed Technical Report
I've attached a comprehensive technical report (`VTIGER_ADMIN_RESOLUTION.md`) with:
- Complete error details and test cases
- Step-by-step resolution procedures  
- Specific settings to check and modify
- Testing validation process

## Business Impact
- **Daily**: 3+ hours manual work that should be automated
- **Response Time**: Lead follow-up delayed from <24 hours to daily batches
- **Project**: $50K+ automation project completely blocked

## Timeline Request
- **Day 1**: Initial settings review and changes
- **Day 2**: Joint testing to validate resolution
- **Day 3**: Development team can resume full implementation

## Next Steps
1. Please review the attached technical report
2. Let me know when you're available to make the configuration changes
3. I'm available for immediate testing once changes are implemented

This is our highest priority issue as it blocks a significant business automation initiative. Please let me know how quickly we can resolve this.

Thank you for your urgent assistance.

Best regards,  
Elvis
